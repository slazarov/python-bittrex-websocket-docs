Methods
=======

.. _methods:

The names of the methods follow closely the naming conventions of the
official `Bittrex Websocket API <https://github.com/Bittrex/bittrex.github.io>`_.
I highly advise everyone to familiarise themselves with the official documentation.

Custom URLs
-----------
Custom URLs can be passed to the client upon instantiating.

.. code:: python

    # 'https://socket.bittrex.com/signalr' (DEFAULT)
    # 'https://beta.bittrex.com/signalr' will be deprecated

    # Create the socket instance
    ws = MySocket(url=None)
    # rest of your code

Order Book Class Methods
------------------------
Order book sync is currently supported for the non-async version of the client (**version >=1.0.6.2**).

.. code:: python

    from bittrex_websocket import OrderBook

    def subscribe_to_orderbook(tickers):
    """
    Allows the caller to subscribe to order book sync for a ticker.

    :param tickers: A list of tickers you are interested in.
    :type tickers: []
    """

    def get_order_book(ticker):
    """
    Returns the order book for a specific ticker

    :param tickers: Specific ticker you are interested in.
    :type tickers: str
    """

    def on_ping(self,msg):
    """
    Message channel which is pinged upon sync update. The message contains the ticker name.
    You have to to create an instance of the class and overwrite the method.
    """

Subscription Methods
--------------------

.. _sub_methods:

Public Subscription Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _pub_sub_methods:

Public subscription methods stream to ``async def on_public(self, msg)``

.. code:: python

    def subscribe_to_exchange_deltas(self, tickers):
        """
        Allows the caller to receive real-time updates to the state of a SINGLE market.
        Upon subscribing, the callback will be invoked with market deltas as they occur.

        This feed only contains updates to exchange state. To form a complete picture of
        exchange state, users must first call QueryExchangeState and merge deltas into
        the data structure returned in that call.

        :param tickers: A list of tickers you are interested in.
        :type tickers: []
