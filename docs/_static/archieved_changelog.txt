-Removed wsaccel: no particular socket benefits
- Fixed RecursionError as per Issue #52

0.0.6.4 - 24/02/2018
- Fixed order book syncing bug when more than 1 connection is online due to wrong connection/thread name.

0.0.6.3 - 18/02/2018

- Fixed on_open bug as per Issue #21

0.0.6.2.2
- Update cfscrape>=1.9.2 and gevent>=1.3a1

0.0.6.2
- Every 5400s (1hr30) the script will force reconnection.
- Every reconnection (including the above) will be done with a fresh cookie
- Upon reconnection the script will check if the connection has been running for more than 600s (10mins). If it has been running for less it will use the backup url.
